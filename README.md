# üõç Myntra Clone (HTML & CSS)

This project is a visual clone of the Myntra website, built completely using HTML and CSS. 
It replicates the site‚Äôs layout, including the navigation bar, product grid, and banners, to mirror the original design closely.

This is one of the best clones I‚Äôve created, with clean structure, smooth alignment, and attractive styling.
I focused on details like spacing, colors, and typography to make it look professional and realistic.

The project helped me improve my frontend design skills by rebuilding a real-world interface from scratch.
It strengthened my understanding of layouts, positioning, and responsive design using only CSS.

While it doesn‚Äôt include dynamic features, the clone accurately captures the look and feel of an e-commerce platform and showcases how HTML and CSS alone can build a polished, modern UI.
