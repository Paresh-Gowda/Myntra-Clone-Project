# üõç Myntra Clone (HTML & CSS)

This project is a visual clone of the popular e-commerce website Myntra, built entirely using HTML and CSS. 
The design aims to replicate the look and feel of the original site, including the navigation bar, product sections, banners, and overall layout.

The purpose of this project was to strengthen my frontend skills by recreating a real-world UI from scratch without using JavaScript.
While the clone does not include dynamic functionality (like cart actions or filtering), it accurately reflects the structure, styling, and responsive design of the original platform.
